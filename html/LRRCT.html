		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<hr class="line">
		<p>Late Ranjanben Ramanlal Charitable Trust was first started in 2016. The idea behind building this trust was to serve people, protect our environment and spread happiness. This idea was first initiated by our President Mr. Mukesh Patel, because of his mother (Ranjanben) and father (Ramanlal), as they used to help other people and provide them with food and help students with their financial aid and carry out other utilities as well so this inspired him to start this trust and also because of that, he named this trust after his parents. Our trust laid down many activities, such as kanyadaan, paying fees for underprivileged students, entertainment for Senior citizens, we also provided food and beverages to needy people. Our trust also planted trees and plants and took out a rally to create awareness among people to lead a healthy and safe lifestyle in our environment.
		</p>
		<p>Our trust also helps out physically and mentally challenged people, we provide them with financial aid, medical aid and entertain them by taking them on trips and playing sports with them. After 2016, our trust was slowed down a bit, but in 2019, our trust paced up and started doing all the major activities again and we aim to create a healthy society by 2025.
